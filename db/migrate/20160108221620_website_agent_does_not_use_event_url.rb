class WebsiteAgentDoesNotUseEventUrl < ActiveRecord::Migration[4.2]
  def up
    # Until this migration, if a WebsiteAgent received Events and did not have a `url_from_event` option set,
    # it would use the `url` from the Event's payload.  If the Event did not have a `url` in its payload, the
    # WebsiteAgent would do nothing. This migration assumes that if someone has wired a WebsiteAgent to receive Events
    # and has not set `url_from_event` or `data_from_event`, they were trying to use the Event's `url` payload, so we
    # set `url_from_event` to `{{ url }}` for them.
