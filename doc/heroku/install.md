## Deploy to Heroku

Huginn works very well on the cheapest Heroku paid plan. This is what we recommend if you want to use Huginn on Heroku.

Notes for any Heroku plan:

* The `setup_heroku` command points Heroku at a special Procfile (`deployment/heroku/Procfile.heroku`) that is designed to be run on only one Heroku web worker.  If you want to run multiple workers, change the Heroku config variable `PROCFILE_PATH` with `heroku config:set PROCFILE_PATH=./Procfile` and switch back to the standard Huginn Procfile configuration.

If you still wish to use the Heroku free plan (which won't work very well), please understand the following:

* Heroku's [free plan](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) limits total runtime per day to 18 hours. This means that Huginn must sleep some of the time, and so recurring tasks will only run if their recurrence frequency fits within the free plan's awake time, which is 30 minutes. Therefore, we recommend that you only use the every 1 minute, every 2 minute, and every 5 minute Agent scheduling options.
* If you're using the free plan, you need to signup for a free [uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com) account and have it ping your Huginn URL on Heroku once every 70 minutes.  If you still receive warnings from Heroku, try a longer interval. 
* Another way if you're using the free plan, you can create a Http Status Agent on your Heroku Huginn instance itself and ping your own domain at huginn-example.herokuapp.com every 10 minutes.
* Heroku's free Postgres plan limits the number of database rows that you can have to 10,000, so you should be sure to set a low event retention schedule for your agents and set `AGENT_LOG_LENGTH`, the number of log lines kept in the DB per Agent, to something small: `heroku config:set AGENT_LOG_LENGTH=20`.
* 512MB of RAM may not be enough for Huginn and it may stop working as RAM usage increases over time.

## Instructions

* Install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and then run `heroku login`
* Go into your huginn directory and run `cp .env.example .env && bundle`
* Now, run the magic setup wizard: `bin/setup_heroku`
* That's it!
* If you make changes, you can re-run `bin/setup_heroku`, or just do `git push heroku master`.
* Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/update.md) when you want to update your Huginn installation.

### Using your own mail server

```bash
# Outgoing email settings.  To use Gmail or Google Apps, put your Google Apps domain or gmail.com
# as the SMTP_DOMAIN and your Gmail username and password as the SMTP_USER_NAME and SMTP_PASSWORD.
heroku config:set SMTP_DOMAIN=your-domain-here.com
heroku config:set SMTP_USER_NAME=you@gmail.com
heroku config:set SMTP_PASSWORD=somepassword
heroku config:set SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com

# The address from which system emails will appear to be sent.
heroku config:set EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=you@gmail.com
```

You need to set an invitation code for your Huginn instance.  If you plan to share this instance, you will
tell this code to anyone who you'd like to invite.  If you won't share it, then just set this to something
that people will not guess.
What code would you like to use?

Okay, let's setup outgoing email settings.  The simplest solution is to use the free sendgrid Heroku addon.
If you'd like to use your own server, or your Gmail account, please see .env.example and set
SMTP_DOMAIN, SMTP_USER_NAME, SMTP_PASSWORD, and SMTP_SERVER with 'heroku config:set'.
Should I enable the free sendgrid addon? (y/n) y
Use `heroku addons:docs sendgrid` to view documentation.
