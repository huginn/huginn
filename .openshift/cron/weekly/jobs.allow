#  Script or job files listed in here (one entry per line) will be
#  executed on a weekly-basis.
#
#  Example: The chronograph script will be executed weekly but the README
#           and chrono.dat files in this directory will be ignored.
#
#           The README file is actually ignored due to the entry in the
#           jobs.deny which is checked before jobs.allow (this file).
