// Responsive: Utility classes
// --------------------------------------------------


// IE10 in Windows (Phone) 8
//
// Support for responsive views via media queries is kind of borked in IE10, for
// Surface/desktop in split view and for Windows Phone 8. This particular fix
// must be accompanied by a snippet of JavaScript to sniff the user agent and
// apply some conditional CSS to *only* the Surface/desktop Windows 8. Look at
// our Getting Started page for more information on this bug.
