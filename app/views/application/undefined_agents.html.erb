        <p>
          You have one or more Agents registered in the database for which no corresponding definition is available in the source code:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <% @undefined_agent_types.each do |type| %>
            <li><%= agent_type_to_human(type) %></li>
          <% end %>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
          This issue probably occurred for one or more of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the respective Agent is distributed as part of the Huginn application codebase, it may have been removed or moved to an Agent gem. Please see <a href="https://github.com/cantino/huginn/wiki/Dealing-with-Deleted-Agent-Types" target="_blank">this wiki page for more information</a>.</li>
          <li>If the respective Agent is distributed as a Ruby gem, it might have been removed from the <code>ADDITIONAL_GEMS</code> environment setting.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
          You can fix this issue by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>deleting the respective Agent(s) from the database using the button below.</li>
          <li>adding the respective Agent(s) to the the <code>ADDITIONAL_GEMS</code> environment setting. Please see <a href="https://github.com/cantino/huginn_agent" target="_blank">https://github.com/cantino/huginn_agent</a> for documentation on how to properly set it.</li>
          <li>adding the respective Agent(s) code to the Huginn application codebase (in case it was deleted accidentally).</li>
        </ul>
