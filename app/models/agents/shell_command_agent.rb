    description <<-MD
      The ShellCommandAgent can execute commands on your local system, returning the output.

      `command` specifies the command to be executed, and `path` will tell ShellCommandAgent in what directory to run this command.

      `expected_update_period_in_days` is used to determine if the Agent is working.

      ShellCommandAgent can also act upon received events. When receiving an event, this Agent's options can interpolate values from the incoming event.
      For example, your command could be defined as `{{cmd}}`, in which case the event's `cmd` property would be used.

      The resulting event will contain the `command` which was executed, the `path` it was executed under, the `exit_status` of the command, the `errors`, and the actual `output`. ShellCommandAgent will not log an error if the result implies that something went wrong.

      *Warning*: This type of Agent runs arbitrary commands on your system, #{Agents::ShellCommandAgent.should_run? ? "but is **currently enabled**" : "and is **currently disabled**"}.
      Only enable this Agent if you trust everyone using your Huginn installation.
      You can enable this Agent in your .env file by setting `ENABLE_INSECURE_AGENTS` to `true`.
