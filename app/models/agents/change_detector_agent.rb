module Agents
  class ChangeDetectorAgent < Agent
    cannot_be_scheduled!

    description <<-MD
      The ChangeDetectorAgent receives a stream of events and emits a new event when a property of the received event changes.

      `property` specifies the property to be watched.

      `expected_update_period_in_days` is used to determine if the Agent is working.

      The resulting event will be a copy of the received event.

    event_description <<-MD
    This will change based on the source event. If you were event from the ShellCommandAgent, your outbound event might look like:

        'exit_status' => '0',
        'errors' => '',
        'output' => '/home/Huginn'
      }

          'property' => '{{output}}',
          'expected_update_period_in_days' => 1
      }
    end

      unless options['property'].present? && options['expected_update_period_in_days'].present?
        errors.add(:base, "The property and expected_update_period_in_days fields are all required.")
