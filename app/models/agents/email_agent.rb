    description <<-MD
      The Email Agent sends any events it receives via email immediately.

      You can specify the email's subject line by providing a `subject` option, which can contain [Liquid](https://github.com/cantino/huginn/wiki/Formatting-Events-using-Liquid) formatting.  E.g.,
      you could provide `"Huginn email"` to set a simple subject, or `{{subject}}` to use the `subject` key from the incoming Event.

      By default, the email body will contain an optional `headline`, followed by a listing of the Events' keys.

      You can customize the email body by including the optional `body` param.  Like the `subject`, the `body` can be a simple message
      or a Liquid template.  You could send only the Event's `some_text` field with a `body` set to `{{ some_text }}`.
      The body can contain simple HTML and will be sanitized. Note that when using `body`, it will be wrapped with `<html>` and `<body>` tags,
      so you do not need to add these yourself.

      You can specify one or more `recipients` for the email, or skip the option in order to send the email to your
      account's default email address.

      You can provide a `from` address for the email, or leave it blank to default to the value of `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` (`#{ENV['EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS']}`).

      You can provide a `content_type` for the email and specify `text/plain` or `text/html` to be sent.
      If you do not specify `content_type`, then the recipient email server will determine the correct rendering.

      Set `expected_receive_period_in_days` to the maximum amount of time that you'd expect to pass between Events being received by this Agent.
