  class TwilioAgent < Agent
    default_schedule "every_10m"

    description <<-MD
      The TwilioAgent receives and collects events and sends them via text message when scheduled.

      It is assumed that events have a `:message`, `:text`, or `:sms` key, the value of which is sent as the content of the text message. You can use Event Formatting Agent if your event does not provide these keys.

      Set `receiver_cell` to the number to receive text messages and `sender_cell` to the number sending them.

      `expected_receive_period_in_days` is maximum number of days that you would expect to pass between events being received by this agent.
