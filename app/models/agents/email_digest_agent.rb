    description <<-MD
      The EmailDigestAgent collects any Events sent to it and sends them all via email when scheduled.

      By default, the will have a `subject` and an optional `headline` before listing the Events.  If the Events'
      payloads contain a `message`, that will be highlighted, otherwise everything in
      their payloads will be shown.

      You can specify one or more `recipients` for the email, or skip the option in order to send the email to your
      account's default email address.

      Set `expected_receive_period_in_days` to the maximum amount of time that you'd expect to pass between Events being received by this Agent.
