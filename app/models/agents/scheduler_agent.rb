    description <<-MD
      The Scheduler Agent periodically takes an action on target Agents according to a user-defined schedule.

      # Action types

      Set `action` to one of the action types below:

      * `run`: Target Agents are run at intervals, except for those disabled.

      * `disable`: Target Agents are disabled (if not) at intervals.

      * `enable`: Target Agents are enabled (if not) at intervals.

      # Targets

      Select Agents that you want to run periodically by this SchedulerAgent.

      # Schedule

      Set `schedule` to a schedule specification in the [cron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) format.
      For example:

      * `0 22 * * 1-5`: every day of the week at 22:00 (10pm)

      * `*/10 8-11 * * *`: every 10 minutes from 8:00 to and not including 12:00

      This variant has several extensions as explained below.

      ## Timezones

      You can optionally specify a timezone (default: `#{Time.zone.name}`) after the day-of-week field using the labels in the [tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)

      * `0 22 * * 1-5 Europe/Paris`: every day of the week when it's 22:00 in Paris

      * `0 22 * * 1-5 Etc/GMT+2`: every day of the week when it's 22:00 in GMT+2

      ## Seconds

      You can optionally specify seconds before the minute field.

      * `*/30 * * * * *`: every 30 seconds

      #{"Only multiples of fifteen are allowed as values for the seconds field, i.e. `*/15`, `*/30`, `15,45` etc." unless second_precision_enabled}

      ## Last day of month

      `L` signifies "last day of month" in `day-of-month`.

      * `0 22 L * *`: every month on the last day at 22:00

      ## Weekday names

      You can use three letter names instead of numbers in the `weekdays` field.

      * `0 22 * * Sat,Sun`: every Saturday and Sunday, at 22:00

      ## Nth weekday of the month

      You can specify "nth weekday of the month" like this.

      * `0 22 * * Sun#1,Sun#2`: every first and second Sunday of the month, at 22:00

      * `0 22 * * Sun#L1`: every last Sunday of the month, at 22:00
