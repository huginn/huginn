    description do <<-MD
      The Webhook Agent will create events by receiving webhooks from any source. In order to create events with this agent, make a POST request to:

      ```
         https://#{ENV['DOMAIN']}/users/#{user.id}/web_requests/#{id || ':id'}/#{options['secret'] || ':secret'}
      ```

      #{'The placeholder symbols above will be replaced by their values once the agent is saved.' unless id}

      Options:

        * `secret` - A token that the host will provide for authentication.
        * `expected_receive_period_in_days` - How often you expect to receive
          events this way. Used to determine if the agent is working.
        * `payload_path` - JSONPath of the attribute in the POST body to be
          used as the Event payload.  Set to `.` to return the entire message.
          If `payload_path` points to an array, Events will be created for each element.
        * `verbs` - Comma-separated list of http verbs your agent will accept.
          For example, "post,get" will enable POST and GET requests. Defaults
          to "post".
        * `response` - The response message to the request. Defaults to 'Event Created'.

        The event payload is based on the value of the `payload_path` option,
